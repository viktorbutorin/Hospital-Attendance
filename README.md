# Hospital-Attendance
This is a dataset with 4 years of patient traffic data. Data analysis project has 3 goals:
1) Find out problem with hospital attendance
2) Outline critical variables and sub-variables behind that problem
3) Forecast patient traffic in the next week/month

Hypotheses tested/steps taken:

1) Dropping columns with obscure/irrelevant data
2) Mapping string values in several columns to 0/1
3) Dropping redundant columns
4) Hypothesis 1: Patients come late
5) Hypothesis 2: It takes more time than scheduled to see on-time patients
6) Hypothesis 3: Patients cancel appointments
7) Outlining critical variables and sub-variables behind high attendance cancellation rate
8) Forecasting patient traffic in the next week/month using SARIMAX
